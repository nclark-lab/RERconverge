#Draft list of function(alitie)s that have been added or revised
#since v0.1.0, to distribute with release of v1.0.0

Addition of tree-estimation functions:

* estimatePhangornTree will estimate branch lengths on a provided
  master tree topology for a single genetic element, based on a provided
  nucleotide or amino acid alignment. This function relies on the `pml`
  and `optim.pml` methods for approximate maximum likelihood estimation
  from the `phangorn` package.

* estimatePhangornTreeAll is a wrapper for estimatePhangornTree that
  will estimate gene trees for a set of alignments, and will write the
  resulting trees to a file that is then readable by `readTrees`.


Improved flexibility for working with master trees:

* users can now specify their own masterTree in readTrees

* users can also reorient the master tree with respect to a provided or
  inferred outgroup (inferred using `midpoint.root`)


New visualization function(s):

* new_plotTreeHighlightBranches (needs to be re-named) uses ggplot for 
  improved visualization of foreground lineages
  Note: requires BioConductor installation
