\title{turns a named vector of characters into a paths vector to be used with \code{\link{getAllCor}} for categorical traits}
\usage{
char2PathsCategorical(
  tipvals,
  treesObj,
  useSpecies = NULL,
  model = "ER",
  plot = FALSE,
  anctrait = NULL,
  root_prior = "auto",
  transition = "unidirectional"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tipvals}{the trait/phenotype/character value at the tip, \code{names(tip.vals)} should match some of the \code{mastertree$tip.label}, though a perfect match is not required}

\item{treesObj}{A treesObj created by \code{\link{readTrees}}}

\item{useSpecies}{Give only a subset of the species to use for ancestral state reconstruction
(e.g., only those species for which the trait can be reliably determined).}

\item{model}{Specifies what rate model to use}

\item{plot}{Plots a phenotype tree}

\item{anctrait}{The trait to use for all ancestral species instead of inferring ancestral states if not NULL. The default is NULL.}

\item{root_prior}{The prior probabilities of each trait at the root used to fit the transition matrix. Can be a vector of length equal to the number of states or one of the following: "flat", "empirical", "stationary", "likelihoods", "max_likelihood".}

\item{transition}{A character string indicating whether transitions between background and foreground branches
are "bidirectional" or "unidirectional" (no foreground to background transitions, the default)
Only used in cases with 2 categories.}
}
\value{
A vector of length equal to the number of paths in treesObj
}
