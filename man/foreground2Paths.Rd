\title{Creates paths from a set of foreground species}
\usage{
foreground2Paths(foreground, treesObj, plotTree = F,
  clade = c("ancestral", "terminal", "all", "weighted"),
  useSpecies = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{treesObj}{A treesObj created by \code{\link{readTrees}}}

\item{plotTree}{Plot a tree representation of the result}

\item{clade}{A character string indicating which branches within the clade
containing the foreground species should be set to foreground. Must be one
of the strings "ancestral", "terminal", "all", or "weighted".}

\item{useSpecies}{Give only a subset of the species to use for ancestral state reconstruction
(e.g., only those species for which the trait can be reliably determined).}

\item{foreground.}{A character vector containing the foreground species}
}
\value{
A vector of length equal to the number of paths in treesObj
}
