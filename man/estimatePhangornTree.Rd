\title{Estimate a ML tree from a given topology
Uses `pml` and `optim.pml` from the `phangorn` package to estimate the tree.}
\usage{
estimatePhangornTree(alnfile, treefile, submodel = "LG", type = "AA",
  format = "fasta", k = 4, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{alnfile}{The path to the sequence alignment file}

\item{treefile}{The path to the master tree file (whose topology will be used to generate the tree)}

\item{submodel}{Substitution model to be used to estimate the tree}

\item{type}{"AA" for amino acid or "DNA" for DNA}

\item{format}{Format of the alignment file (commonly used formats include fasta and phylip)}

\item{k}{Number of intervals in the discrete gamma distribution for `pml`}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to `pml` or `optim.pml`}
}
\value{
A list:
`tree.opt` is the tree from the optimized output of `optim.pml`;
`results.opt` is the optimized output of `optim.pml`;
`results.init` is the initial results estimated by `pml`
}
